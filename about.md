My name is Drew Ehrler, and I'm not doing much of anything at the moment.

I decided to start this blog because I wanted a neat little corner of the internet in
which to post my writing. I love to write essays, and poetry, and short stories, but
it just doesn't feel quite as gratifying if you aren't sharing it with the world. I don't
expect people to read, but I'll feel better knowing that it's out there for people to
stumble upon. Enjoy!
