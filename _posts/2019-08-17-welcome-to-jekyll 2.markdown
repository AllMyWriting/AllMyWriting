While I was working at summer camp this summer I very often found myself going without.
The big one was the camp's "no cell phone" policy, but I was already eager to jump 
at the opportunity to go off the grid (or at the very least to have the grid *dimmed* 
a little). I was already mentally prepared to go without a phone. What I was not prepared
to go without, and what I think no one could prepare for, was peanut butter.

I went two months without peanut butter, and it just about killed me.

I discovered quickly that the things that come together to form our concept of modern
comfort are varied, and the smallest things (like peanut butter) are just as important as,
or maybe even more important than, the big things (like cell phones). The small things
are like cement between bricks, or fine details in Rococo ornamentation: without them,
the structure of the thing--the very nature of it--would crumble.

So, peanut butter was a big one for me. Without it I wasn't really home. So was brewing 
my own coffee in the morning, and being able to watch a specific movie as soon as the 
particular mood strikes me.

So is choosing which music I listen to.

At about week 2 of camp I realized that I didn't bring my earbuds with me, meaning that
I wouldn't be able to listen to my music, even if I really, really wanted to. At first
I was crushed: it was a feeling similar to when you realized you forgot your earbuds at
home when you reach for them on the bus, except instead of going the day without music
you're going 50 days. Once the initial waves of panic passed, though, I was able to see
a silver lining to the situation. I could spend two months wallowing in self-pity, or I 
could view my lot as a chance to push my Deprivation Experiment to its limit. 
After all, how often does a person get to experience the world without their music?

With the parameters of my new experiment set, I went about my daily life at camp. I had
predicted that I would be painfully aware of the silence that I typically filled with
music at home, so I was surprised to find out that I barely noticed them at all. In fact,
I began to notice something strange about my brain in those silences. I had always
assumed that music was something that I put into my body to nourish some part of me, 
like food or water. If this was the case, then without I would experience some kind of
withdrawal. What I found, though, was that in the absence of music to listen to, music
began to bubble up from inside me. The desire shifted from wanting to *listen* to music to
wanting to *make* music.

So I started singing. Constantly. All it took was for someone to say something that
vaguely resembled a lyric of a song I knew and that song would be in my head all day. If
you can't listen to someone else sing it, sing it yourself, I guess.

That's where this playlist came from. I was so excited by this revelation in the
direction of my brainflow that I began keeping a meticulous record of it. Any song that
got stuck in my head, whether I liked it or not, ended up on the list. The result is a
playlist that I feel highlights the breadth of my musical tastes (not to mention it's 
chock full of bangers). The majority of the songs that pushed their way to the forefront
of my consciousness were ones that have some sort of intense emotion attached to them, so
the playlist also ended up being bit of a walk down memory lane for me, as well. Overall,
a supremely satisfying experiment: I got to feel a little bit of that symbiotic
relationship between my music and me, and I ended up with a nice little memento to 
remember camp by.

Without further ado, that relic, for your <a href="https://open.spotify.com/playlist/4KZQ2qINrDGPuhvTtONWRX?si=oj_bZRXJTEaDxBnONwL4Cw">own personal listening enjoyment</a>
